//The goal of this Bag of Marbles program is to have various ways to add and remove 
//different variety of marbles from a bag. The marbles can be of different colors, 
//different sizes, but no matter what properties, they should be removed or added to 
//the bag at will. They can be removed one at a time. There can be an extremely small
 //number or very large, in the millions of marbles added to an infintely sized bag.
