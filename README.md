# assignment1-CS260 README BAG OF MARBLES

The goal of this Bag of Marbles program is to have various ways to add and remove different variety of marbles from a bag. The marbles can be of different colors, different sizes, but no matter what properties, they should be removed or added to the bag at will. They can be removed one at a time. There can be an extremely small number or very large, in the millions of marbles added to an infintely sized bag.

We will start with our complete marble collection OUTSIDE the bag, whatever number it is.

Our PROPERTIES of the marbles can include:
Color (red, blue, green etc.)
Size (Small, Medium, Large)

BEHAVIORS of marbles:
Add specific marble to bag (random option?)
Remove specific from bag (random option?)

There will be 'char' to represent the 

For the bag properties, it's not as important as the marbles: just the size of the bag.
At the beginning of the program, we could request the user input 'How many MAX marbles should this bag hold?' Zero would be an error, but a number in the billions could be allowed. (Possibly stopping after 20 digits or less).
